# Java Stream API Mini-Test Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a set of carefully crafted problems designed to test and demonstrate proficiency with the **Java Stream API**. The problems cover a range of difficulty levels and Stream API features such as `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `collect`, custom collectors, and grouping operations.
